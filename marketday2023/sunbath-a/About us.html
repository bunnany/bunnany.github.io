     <h1> Our goals: </h1> 
    <ul>
    <p>To make profit = we personally feel that we will be able to make profit of our products because they are so unique. We will be selling them for $3.00 for 1 sausage or $5.00 for 2 sausages. To make 225 sausages, it will cost $160.39. This means each sausage only cost about $0.71 to make.</p>
    <p>To work as a team = to make our product and market day stall work, we need to work as team and have good communication skills because without this our team/stall could fall apart</p>
    <p>To Create a unique idea =  Our group are wanting to create something that hasn't been created before but a product that people will still like so that is why we decided to create a beached themed sausage sizzle.
</p>
  </ul>
      <h1>The USP</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>The unique selling point for our product is that its beach themed. Wanting to go to the beach but itâ€™s too cold then our sausages will help you feel like your at the beach by Escaping to the beach with one bite. Our product will stand out from the competition because its a product where people will feel that they are escaping to a summer's day.</p>
    </ul>
    <h1>Target Market</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>Our target market are HUNGRY high school students and our design in cool and fun which will make it appealing to our target market.</p>
    </ul>
    <h1>Why this is a good idea</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>Sausages are an easy quick, yummy thing to make. They are affordable and a great savory thing to eat for lunch. Sausage sizzles are usually in the summer so sunbathing sausages is a great theme to tie in that summery feel.</p>
    </ul>
