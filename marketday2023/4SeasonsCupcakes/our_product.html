            <p>The cupcakes’ cute and simplistic design attracts our target market of students ages 5 and up, while keeping costs down. This means we will be able to afford making many cupcakes and we will have the market for them. Market research across every year level in WGC suggests that our agreed upon options will be the most likely to sell. The caramel-chocolate, vanilla-mixed berry, apple spice and lemon flavoured cupcakes are clearly the most favoured flavour combinations out of the students who participated in the survey. 
The majority of people who participated in the survey have no allergies, but to attract potential customers, our lemon flavour of cupcake is gluten free, and all the cupcakes are nut free and vegetarian. </p>
            <h3> PRICE </h3>
            <p>Our luxury cupcakes will fill your sweet tooth while not breaking
the budget for just $3 each! Payment can be paid through bank transfers and cash.</p>
