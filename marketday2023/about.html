            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Year 10 Market Day is an annual tradition at WGC. We are not entirely sure when it started, but we estimate almost 30 years since the first Market Day. Until 2022, Market Day was held on the quad and in the hall, however in 2022 we moved to the Brook courts. Previously Market Day was for WGC students only, however to expand the target market, Thorndon School staff and students are invited. It is a really exciting day seeing ƒÅkonga from years 1 to year 13 enjoy the vast array of food and non food items. Some of the non food items have included, Bracelets, Henna, Scrunchies and carnival games.  Market Day is an authentic real life adventure for all involved.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Year 10 Economics and Enterprise students put together a Business Plan to create a completely new brand. Before teams can go ahead, they must face up to the "Dragon's Den". Here the teams pitch their idea and aim for a green light. Then they advertise and create their product, and finally sell it at Market Day.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>This year the event is on 15th September starting at 12pm for the Thorndon School students and 12.45pm for WGC students. There will be around 40 stalls. A map of all stalls is coming soon!</p>
